<!--I've been working as a Software Engineer since Feb 2021. And I have been simultaneously learning and working on my skills for getting into Cybersecuirty domain.-->

#### exploring/working on
not much, wasting time more...

#### modus operandi
<!-- I love speaking different languages. I can speak English, Kannada and Hindi, learnt Sanskrit in School. I can understand Telugu and Tamil (to an extent). 
I love studying History, Geography, current affairs, DIY hacks and all the small things in life. -->

I dream more than I work. I think unwanted things more than I solve.

I'll let you know when I find out more about myself.
